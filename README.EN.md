All DNS requests are forwarded through an encrypted channel to the upstream server `tls://1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com`, ensuring your queries are secure and fast.

## Privacy Protection
We commit to **not logging any DNS query records**. Your privacy is our top priority, and we do not collect, store, or share any data related to you.
